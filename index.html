            <h2>- About the Equipment Center Experience</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Over the past three semesters, my role at the NYUAD Arts and Equipment Center has been instrumental in guiding my project development.
                This opportunity provided access to cutting-edge equipment and resources, essential for exploring the intersection of technology and creative expression.
                Handling state-of-the-art tools not only expanded technical expertise but also deepened understanding of their practical applications in artistic endeavors.
                The Equipment Center's supportive environment fosters growth and offers invaluable insights into integrating technology into creative pursuits.
